#### ***Description***
######
This application was assigned as my capstone project to demonstrate my overall knowledge and skills after completing my 12 week software engineering immersive program with General Assembly. I choose to build a full-stack M.E.R.N(Mongoose/Express/React/Node) e-commerce application. Prior to transitioning into the tech field, I developed a clothing line for graphic T-shirt and Hoodies. My online store was created using shopify and I choose to challenge myself to recreate my website from scratch while implementing the same functionality.

#### ***Technologies Used*** 
* Mongoose
* Express
* React
    *React Authentication
